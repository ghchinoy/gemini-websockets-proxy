# WebSockets proxy for Gemini Multimodal Live API

A Go proxy service for the Vertex AI Gemini Multimodal Live WebSockets API.

This uses the gorilla/websocket library which, by default, enforces the origin of the WebSocket connection for security reasons. This prevents cross-site WebSocket hijacking attacks.
